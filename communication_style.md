# Communication Style Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Direct and Concise
- Lead with the conclusion, then provide context
- No fluff or unnecessary pleasantries in written communication
- Bullet points over paragraphs for status updates
- "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) format preferred

### 2. Data-Driven Messaging
- Always include metrics when discussing progress
- Quantify impact whenever possible
- Avoid vague terms like "significant improvement" — use percentages

### 3. Action-Oriented
- Every message should have clear next steps
- Specify owners and deadlines explicitly
- Use action verbs: "Decide", "Ship", "Block", "Escalate"

## Writing Templates

### Status Update Format
```
**Status:** [On Track / At Risk / Blocked]
**Progress:** [X]% complete
**Key Updates:**
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
**Blockers:** [None / Description]
**Next Steps:** [Action items with owners]
```

### Decision Request Format
```
**Decision Needed:** [One sentence]
**Context:** [2-3 sentences max]
**Options:**
1. Option A — [Pros/Cons]
2. Option B — [Pros/Cons]
**Recommendation:** [Your pick and why]
**Deadline:** [When decision needed by]
```

### Escalation Format
```
**Issue:** [One sentence description]
**Impact:** [Business/customer impact]
**Root Cause:** [If known]
**Ask:** [What you need from me]
**Timeline:** [Urgency level]
```

## Tone Guidelines

### DO ✓
- Be respectful but not deferential
- Challenge ideas constructively
- Acknowledge good work specifically ("Great job on X" not just "Great job")
- Use "we" for team accomplishments
- Be transparent about uncertainty

### DON'T ✗
- Use passive voice to avoid accountability
- Bury bad news at the end
- Over-apologize
- Use jargon without context
- Send messages without proofreading

## Channel Preferences
| Type | Channel | Response Time |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Urgent/Blocking | Slack DM + @mention | < 1 hour |
| Important, not urgent | Email | < 24 hours |
| FYI/Async | Email or Doc comment | 48+ hours |
| Complex discussions | Meeting or Loom | Scheduled |

## Pet Peeves
- Meetings that could have been emails
- "Quick sync" requests without agenda
- Reply-all threads
- Vague subject lines
- Messages that start with "Sorry to bother you..."
